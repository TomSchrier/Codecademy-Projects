# Number Guesser

In this project, you’ll write four functions in **script.js**. We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in **game.js** that will call your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at **game.js** and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your functions are named exactly as specified so that they can be called correctly when the game is played.

This JavaScript project is probably different from most of the ones you’ve completed at Codecademy. Instead of just seeing text output from your program, your JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses HTML/CSS. You’ll learn more about how to do this from scratch as you continue your JavaScript journey.

## Project Goals
In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.
