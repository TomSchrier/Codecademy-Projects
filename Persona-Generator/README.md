## Persona Generator
This project is a variation of the "Mixed Messages" JavaScript syntax portfolio project  from Codecademy. The project description is as follows:

> For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every
> time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
> Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms,
> like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical
> jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs
> should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take
> what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and
> customize it to your liking.

I have modified the project so that it generates a random persona instead of a random message.

## Project Objectives

-   Build a message generator program using JavaScript
-   Use Git version control
-   Use command line
-   Develop locally on your computer

## How to use it

The program is designed to run with node.js. When the script is opened, it generates five random persona.
